### 🚀 About Me
Staff-level iOS engineer building scalable, reliable, and developer-friendly mobile platforms.

- Architected and modernized **Trips section** at Priceline end-to-end — modular, performant, and production-ready in one month.  
- Improved **crash-free rate to 99.98 %** across a **1 M+ user base** with better logging, analytics, and observability (Splunk, Instabug).  
- Drove **CI/CD modernization** using CircleCI + Fastlane + GitHub Actions → ~40 % less manual release overhead.  
- Introduced **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** for shared business logic across iOS & Android.  
- Mentored engineers, ran TDD / KMP workshops, and led platform-wide architectural discussions.  

I focus on translating complex system goals into elegant, testable, and maintainable architectures — shipping faster without breaking things.
